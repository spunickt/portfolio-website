      <p class="about-text">
        One of the reasons I became a front end developer was because I love
        designing things, and am constantly trying to improve my skills.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        My background is in Media Studies, so Iâ€™m especially interested in
        issues related to the internet, analysis of culture, and interactivity.
        I also love making things, which means that my current focus is web
        design, user experience, and interface design,but I have found front-end
        development incredibly rewarding. I am always looking for ways to
        improve my skills though, so any feedback or tips is welcome.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Over the last year and a half I have been building custom web
        applications for small businesses. I have focused on building
        applications in JavaScript, but have also worked in other languages such
        as Python and Go. My main goal has been to build applications that are
        useful to my clients, but have also allowed me to learn new things. I
        have been fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work with some
        really talented people, and I have learned a lot from them.
